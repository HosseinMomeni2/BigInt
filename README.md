# BigInt

Today I was in the middle of a contest and one of my answers kept getting wrong answer from the judge!!!
I found that the problem was with large numbers, but that was kind of wired considering that I was using "long long" variables @-@

So I decided to write something like this code to handle the problem and I think it looks cool

P.S : I may overused my brain because just after submitting the code I found that the "unsigned long long" was the key for the answer -_-
