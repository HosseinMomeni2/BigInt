# BigNum

Today, I was in the middle of a contest, and one of my answers kept getting a wrong answer from the judge! I found that the problem was with large numbers, which was kind of weird considering that I was using “long long” variables. @-@

So, I decided to write something like this code to handle the problem, and I think it looks cool.

P.S.: I may have overused my brain because just after submitting the code, I found that “unsigned long long” was the key to the answer. -_-
